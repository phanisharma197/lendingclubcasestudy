## General Information

- Provide general information about your project here.
  Analysing past loan applicant data to identify default patterns, enabling informed
  decisions on loan approvals, amounts, and interest rates for risk management. We are using EDA to solve this problem

- What is the background of your project?
  The data given contains information about past loan applicants and whether they
  ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to
  default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the
  amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate

- What is the business problem that your project is trying to solve?
  Finding the delinquent customers 

- What is the dataset that is being used?
  loan.csv

## Conclusions
Univariate Analysis:
• Applicants who use the loan to clear other debts
• Applicants who have taken short term loan that is around 36
• Applicants whose grade is B and subgrade is 5
• Applicants who have applied in 2011 and month Dec
• Applicants who have credit line between 1980 to 1999
• Applicants whose interest rate is between 11% to 12%
• Applicants who have just 2-10 open credit lines
• Applicants who have income between 31 to 58
• Applicants whose income source is not verified
 Bivariate Analysis
• Applicant have high annual income since median is around 60K either have Mortgage or other house ownership
• Applicant having the high income they usually apply for home improvement ,house or small business
• Applicant who is having the higher annual income and getting high loan amount
• Applicant whose rate of interest is very high as compared to the interest of the applicants who have fully paid the loan
• Applicant who revolve the spend amount more
• Applicant who is having the higher instalment amount

These insights provide lenders with valuable information to identify high-risk applicants and develop strategies to reduce potential financial losses.
